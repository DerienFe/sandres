<H2>Installing SAnDReS 2.0 (Linux)</H2>  
You need Python 3 installed on your computer to run SAnDReS 2.0. In addition, you also need Matplotlib, NumPy, scikit-learn, SciPy, and XGBoost. It is also necessary to have AutoDock Vina installed on your computer. You can make the installation of Python packages faster by installing Anaconda. 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Step 1. Install Anaconda (available here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Step 2. Install AutoDock Vina (available here: http://vina.scripps.edu/download.html)
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Step 3. Install XGBoost (available here: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#python)
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Step 4. Download SAnDReS 2.0 (available here: https://github.com/azevedolab/sandres/raw/master/sandres2.zip). Unzip the zipped directory (sandres2.zip) and move the sandres2 directory to wherever you want it.
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Step 5. Open a terminal and cd to sandres2 directory then, type: python run_program.py 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
Now we have the GUI window for SAnDReS 2.0. That´s it, good SAnDReS session. By December 2021, we will have a tutorial page for additional information about how to run SAnDReS.
